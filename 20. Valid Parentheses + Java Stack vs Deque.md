## Stack

The Stack class represents a last-in-first-out (LIFO) stack of objects. It extends class Vector with five operations that allow a vector to be treated as a stack. The usual push and pop operations are provided, as well as a method to peek at the top item on the stack, a method to test for whether the stack is empty, and a method to search the stack for an item and discover how far it is from the top.
When a stack is first created, it contains no items.

### Stack Methods: 
- boolean	empty()	:Tests if this stack is empty.
- E	peek()	:Looks at the object at the top of this stack without removing it from the stack.
- E	pop()	:Removes the object at the top of this stack and returns that object as the value of this function.
- E	push​(E item)	:Pushes an item onto the top of this stack.
- int	search​(Object o)	:Returns the 1-based position where an object is on this stack.


## Deque
public interface Deque<E>
extends Queue<E>
This interface is a member of the Java Collections Framework.
A more complete and consistent set of LIFO stack operations is provided by the Deque interface and its implementations, which should be used in preference to this class. For example:
Deque<Integer> stack = new ArrayDeque<Integer>();

A linear collection that supports element insertion and removal at both ends. The name deque is short for "double ended queue" and is usually pronounced "deck". Most Deque implementations place no fixed limits on the number of elements they may contain, but this interface supports capacity-restricted deques as well as those with no fixed size limit.

This interface defines methods to access the elements at both ends of the deque. Methods are provided to insert, remove, and examine the element. Each of these methods exists in two forms: one throws an exception if the operation fails, the other returns a special value (either null or false, depending on the operation). The latter form of the insert operation is designed specifically for use with capacity-restricted Deque implementations; in most implementations, insert operations cannot fail.

### Deque Methods: 
Deques can be used as LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) stacks. This interface should be used in preference to the legacy Stack class. When a deque is used as a stack, elements are pushed and popped from the beginning of the deque. Stack methods are equivalent to Deque methods as indicated in the table below:

### Comparison of Stack and Deque methods: 
- Stack Method	Equivalent Deque Method
- push(e)	== addFirst(e) 加入stack最后位置
- pop()	== removeFirst() 删除stack最后位置
- peek() ==	getFirst() 看stack最后面的Value

### 同理，我们可以看一下Deque对于FIFO的对应方法：
This interface extends the Queue interface. When a deque is used as a queue, FIFO (First-In-First-Out) behavior results. Elements are added at the end of the deque and removed from the beginning. The methods inherited from the Queue interface are precisely equivalent to Deque methods as indicated in the following table:
Comparison of Queue and Deque methods：
- Queue Method	Equivalent Deque Method
- add(e) ==	addLast(e)
- offer(e) ==	offerLast(e)
- remove() ==	removeFirst()
- poll() ==	pollFirst()
- element()	== getFirst()
- peek() == peekFirst()

## 应用举例 20. Valid Parentheses

```
class Solution {
    public boolean isValid(String s) {
        
        if (s.length() == 0 ||s.length() == 1){
            return false;
        }
        
        Deque <Character> stack = new ArrayDeque <Character>();
        
        // Stack <Character> stack = new LinkedList <>();有试过这样写，不对
        
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++){
            
            char c = s.charAt(i);
            if (c == '(' || c == '[' || c == '{') {
                stack.addFirst(c);
            } else {
                if (stack.size() == 0) { //这里是一个corner case，如果不加的话“()}”这个，stack为空，会有NullException
                    return false;
                }
                char o = stack.removeFirst();                
            
                if (getPair(o, c) == false){
                    return false;
                   }
                }
            }
        
        if (stack.size() == 0) {
            return true;
        }
        
        return false;
    }

private boolean getPair(char o, char c) {
    
    switch (o) {
    
    case '(':
         if (c == ')') return true;
         break; //一开始以为有return true，就没有加break，结果错了
    case '{':
         if (c == '}') return true;
         break; //一开始以为有return true，就没有加break，结果错了
    case '[':
         if (c == ']') return true;
         break; //一开始以为有return true，就没有加break，结果错了
    //default:
            //return false; default不用写，没什么用
    }
    
    return false; //就算有switch, 也要加上return statement, if else则不用写
}
}
```
